This project deliverable was for the statistics module of the Data Analyst NanoDegree. The report is an investigation into the Stroop effect. The report looks at two datasets. The first dataset was already provided and the second dataset was generated by myself taking the Stroop test. 

The report explains both datasets using statistical analysis such as mean, standard deviation etc.
