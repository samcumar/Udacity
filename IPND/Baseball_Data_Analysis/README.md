I chose the Data Analyst stream of the Introduction to Programming NanoDegree. I chose to analyse the baseball dataset. 
The data files for this project was taken from the site http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/.
I downloaded the CSV version for 2015 season. The questions I wanted to ask of the dataset was:
* Does the average salary of a team play a major role in determining if they would win the world series? In other words, does it mean that having a high payroll will greatly assist in winning a world series?
Aside from salary, are there other stats that can be used to help determine as to whether the team is more likely towin the world series?
